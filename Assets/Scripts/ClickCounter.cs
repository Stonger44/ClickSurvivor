public class ClickCounter : MonoBehaviour

CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
    Create a tiny click-counter survival game. 
    A UI bar slowly deflates; the only way to keep it from hitting zero is to click a button that refills the bar by a small amount. 
    Display an optional click count. 
    When the bar reaches zero, the game is effectively over (you can stop input or show a simple “Game Over” message).

CHALLENGE GOALS
    1. Build a minimal “keep-alive” clicker using Unity UI.
    2. Make a progress bar that continuously decreases over time using Time.deltaTime.
    3. Increase the bar by a fixed amount when a UI Button is clicked.
    4. Expose difficulty settings (drain rate, click gain) in the Inspector.
